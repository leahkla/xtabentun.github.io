Welcome. This is the first drafted post of a brand new blog for data visualization projects and things alike. And as you might've noticed, the topics will be located somewhere between *a damn fine cup of coffee* and *The Great Northern* -- to the town of Twin Peaks. In a nutshell, the blog will be dedicated to various topics in Data Visualization through the lens of David Lynch's and Mark Frost's [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks).
